<p align="center">🍄 In this framework, we deploy and interact with a contract on testnet which is desined to handle adding and removing members from a DAO through a simple voting protocol, and then use a simple react app to make dao interaction easy 🍄</p>

> Protocol 
> > A DAO member can initate a vote if and only if there is no current round active. A DAO member can add a vote or end a round if and only if there is a round active
